# pixiv-monitor

pixiv-monitor is a Python script for monitoring Pixiv artist galleries, so you can stay up-to-date on your favorite anime pictures.

It supports RSS and sending notifications using ntfy.

## Installing

1. Make sure you have Python 3 on your computer
2. Clone the repository
3. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Done

If you're on Windows, it's recommended to run the script in a terminal that supports ANSI escape sequences,
such as Windows Terminal.

Before running the script (`main.py`), you'll need to configure it as described below.

## Configuring

Before using pixiv-monitor, you have to configure it.

First copy `settings-example.json` as `settings.json`. In the `settings.json` file, you'll need to set a few options:

1. `artist_ids`: A list of IDs of the artists whose galleries you want to monitor.
   * You can also set up multiple monitors for groups of artists. See "Multiple monitors" section below.
1. `check_interval`: How often to check, in seconds.
1. `notifications_off`: Enable this option to disable system notifications.
1. `num_threads`: Number of threads to use to check for artists. More threads speeds up the process, especially if you monitor many artists. Make sure you don't set it too high **or the script (and possibly your system) might break.**
1. `log`: Options for logging described below.
1. `ntfy_topic`: Topic in which to send notifications using `ntfy.sh`. Skip this option if you don't need `ntfy.sh` notifications.

### Logging options

1. `backup_count`: How many log files to keep.
1. `max_size`: Maximum size of one log file in MiB.
1. `directory`: What directory to keep log files in.
1. `level`: Minimum log level. `debug` / `info` / `warning` / `error` / `critical`

### Multiple monitors

The `settings-example.json` file demonstrates an example of using multiple monitors. You may add as many monitors as you need,
with their own artist ID list, among other settings.

In particular, you can set one or multiple accounts per monitor. For example, one monitor can have two accounts, while the
other can have only one. The indexes correspond to the `.env` file. If not set, it'll switch using all configured accounts.

### Hooks

pixiv-monitor can run one or more commands when it finds a new illustration. They can be listed in the `settings.json` file like so:

```json
"hooks": [
	["py", "some_command.py"],
	["./hook.sh"]
]
```
Each hook is run with the following arguments: `illustration ID` `title` `caption` `tags` `artist ID` `artist name` `artist stacc`

For example, for `["py", "some_command.py"]`, it will run something like:

```bash
py some_command.py 134882136 "ダイワスカーレット" "ウマ！" "アナログ / traditional, Traditional, SD, デフォルメ / chibi, 女の子 / girl, ウマ娘 / Umamusume, ウマ娘プリティーダービー / Uma Musume Pretty Derby, ダイワスカーレット(ウマ娘) / Daiwa Scarlet (UMPD)" 118871128 "moltony" "moltony2"
```

### Authentication

It's best to create a separate Pixiv account if you want to use the site in the browser without hitting a rate limit.

Copy `.env.example` as `.env` and set the `REFRESH_TOKEN0` variable. This is your Pixiv refresh token.

The `.env` file should now look like this:

```
REFRESH_TOKEN0='your-refresh-token'
```

You can also add multiple accounts by adding `REFRESH_TOKEN1`, `REFRESH_TOKEN2` and so on.

### System notifications

To get system notifications to work, you'll need to install some stuff depending on your OS.

#### Linux

You'll need to install the python dbus package. Commands for the most common distros:

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-dbus # debian and ubuntu
sudo dnf install -y python3-dbus # fedora red hat
sudo pacman -S python-dbus # arch btw
sudo zypper install python3-dbus # opensuse (option 1)
sudo zypper install dbus-1-python # opensuse (option 2)
```

If nothing works, you can try using the pip package:

```bash
pip install dbus-python
```

#### Windows

Install `winotify`:

```bash
pip install winotify
```

## Command-line arugments

* `--list-artists` List currently configured artists
* `--debug-log` Output debugging logs into the console

## RSS

To add RSS, simply run `rssmain.py` alongside `main.py`. It will automatically create the RSS file (`pixiv.atom`), which can then either be accessed locally or served using an HTTP server.
